# EHDB

EHDB is the Event Horizon Database for the NoETL ecosystem.

It is an Arrow-native distributed database and catalog platform that
stores operational metadata transactionally and stores analytical,
historical data in multi-cloud object storage.

## Goals

- Store NoETL system metadata and catalog data without relying on an
  external PostgreSQL catalog at the self-hosting milestone.
- Keep the catalog inside the database as first-class transactional
  state.
- Use Apache Arrow datatypes and Arrow IPC/Flight as native boundaries.
- Store immutable analytical data files in S3, GCS, Azure Blob, and
  compatible object stores.
- Separate write nodes, read nodes, and bounded maintenance jobs.

## Workspace

|-- ehdb-core      # identifiers, errors, Arrow schema helpers
|-- ehdb-catalog   # catalog model and reference in-memory catalog
`-- ehdb-storage   # object-store traits and local reference adapter
```

## Developer Loop

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo test --workspace
```
